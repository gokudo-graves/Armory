# Wildstar "Armory" project ##
[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/ws-armory/Armory/~chat)

## Overview ##

The main idea of this project is to provide a way for [Wildstar](http://wildstar-online.com/) players to share a link to their equipment (to post it on forums or in a guide for example).

The [website](http://ws-armory.github.io/) is used for two things: visualize the equipments and get a short link for sharing purpose.

It is possible to get a link to your equipment in-game using the [Armory addon](http://http://curse.com/project/225711) for Wildstar. It is also possible to build your own list ([more](https://github.com/ws-armory/ws-armory.github.io#building-custom-lists)).


## Developer Notes ##

This addon uses the [LibArmory library](https://github.com/ws-armory/LibArmory) to generate links to equiped items on the [ws-armory.github.io](http://ws-armory.github.io/) website.

## The website ##

More details about the website internals can be found on it's [dedicated webpage](https://github.com/ws-armory/ws-armory.github.io).
